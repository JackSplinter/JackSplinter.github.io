BridgeQ - a simple game, where you connect islands with bridges.  

It works perfectly on Mozilla Firefox browser (PC and mobile), but it freezes on Chrome, Brave, Edge or Opera. 
It was created in 2009 using PHP + HTML + JavaScript + CSS and it worked well. 
In 2022 I altered it to work without PHP, so it can work at GitHub Pages, and now it only works on Mozilla Firefox. 
I don't know why.

It works on Chrome etc. only when it is opened directly as an HTML file in the browser, not from a http://localhost or http://jacksplinter.github.io
